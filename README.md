## Game Overview

**Memory Game** involves matching pairs of cards that are hidden. Players flip two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If a match is made, the player continues to flip two more cards. If the cards don't match, they are flipped back over. The game continues until all pairs have been found, and the player wins if the time does not run out. Pokemon characters are chosen as it is a childhood favourite of mine.

### How to Play:

1. Click on any two cards to begin.
2. Match all the cards within 30 seconds to win.
3. Click restart to begin a new round.
